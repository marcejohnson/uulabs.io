# Case Study: Competing with Amazon

## Background

UU Labs worked with a leading global electronics company to embed wireless hardware in high performance "smart" race cars enabling the transmission of real time data to pit crews. Accurate analysis and data fidelity in an extreme environment, such as a race track, anticipated the challenges of the forthcoming self-driving revolution.

## Hardware, Software and Data

To realize this project, UU Labs developed low level network protocols on custom hardware as part of the data capture system. The rise of IOT (Internet of Things) is allowing many new opportunities to economically deploy hardware and software, collect data, and support work spanning from R&D to business intelligence.

## Moble

UU Labs recognizes that mobile application development is about more than phones and can help businesses gain valuable insights into their future.
