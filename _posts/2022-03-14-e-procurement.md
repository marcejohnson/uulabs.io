# Case Study: Lowering Costs Through E-Procurement

## Background

As part of a multi-year project, UU Labs re-engineered and updated an enterprise e-procurement system supplying thousands of parts daily to factories, labs, and industrial facilities. Redeveloping an existing platform presented technical challenges and allowed for innovations delivering significant immediate benefits to partners. 

## Automating Industrial Supply and Inventory Management

UU Labs's platform allows members to economically manage their supply chains. Additionally, an integrated mobile scanner application supports an easy-to-use e-procurement and inventory management tool. A best-in-class automated "pull" system, UU Lab's technology allows businesses to manage supplies with unprecedented efficiency while making tasks easier for staff to perform. 

UU Labs has realized savings for diverse industries spanning from manufacturers of machine parts to suppliers of NASA missions.
